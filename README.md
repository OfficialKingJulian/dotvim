# VIM Config

This is seperate from my main dotfile config because I really rely on / love the bindings, shortcuts, spellcheckings, and Goyo, and other stuff my vimrc and other .vim files offer. 

## Installation 

Tested installations on Debian and Windows 10. 

First `git clone https://github.com/OfficialKingJulian/vim`

then `cd vim`

then it's either `./vimstall` or `vimstall.cmd`

then remember to enter a file with vim and run `:PlugInstall` to complete
